## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The app was very simple to build, but you can always run into import problems and running the emulator on low-end apps can be annoying. 
The Android Studio is very user-friendly and easy to use. It also gives the developer a lot of freedom to play around with the UI.
